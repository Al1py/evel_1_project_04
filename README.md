# 📦 BigBlue – level_1_project_04

A simple grocery shopping UI built using Flutter.  
This project displays a selection of products in a clean and modern `GridView` layout. It's a training step within my level 1 learning path.

## 🛠️ Project Details

- ✅ Uses **Poppins** font via Google Fonts.
- ✅ Features:
  - A custom `AppBar` with the title "BigBlue".
  - A search bar.
  - A cart icon with notification badge.
  - A grid view of product cards.
- ✅ Product images are stored in `assets/screenshots`.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Practice designing user interfaces in Flutter.
- Master layout distribution using `GridView`.
- Learn styling and spacing for real-world app look & feel.

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to use custom fonts with Google Fonts.
- UI layout with `Padding`, `SizedBox`, `Row`, `Column`.
- Manually creating product cards inside a `GridView`.
- Using `Stack` to overlay a badge on the cart icon.

---

## 🧱 Challenges Faced

- Repeated product cards manually (planning to refactor with List and Builder).
- Balancing color and spacing to keep the design clean.

---

## 📌 Notes for Future (level_1_project_05)

- Define a `Product` class and store product data in a List.
- Use `GridView.builder` instead of manual repetition.
- Extract reusable widgets for product cards.
- Add functionality for Favorites and Cart.
